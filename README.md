# TinyMachines.jl

[![Build Status](https://github.com/cirobr/TinyMachines.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/cirobr/TinyMachines.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

A collection of tiny machine learning models for semantic segmentation of images on IoT devices, written in Julia/Flux.

### UNet5, UNet4, UNet2

UNet5 is the classic U-Net architecture, with five encoder/decoder levels. UNet4 and UNet2 have, respectively, four and two. Number of channels can be modulated to increase/decrease size.

The standard implementation follows the paper "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)). Paper credits: Ronnenberger, Olaf; Fischer, Philipp; and Brox, Thomas.


### MobileUNet

Mobile-Unet utilizes inverted residual bottleneck blocks and pointwise convolution.

Implementation follows the paper "Mobile-Unet: An efficient convolutional neural network for fabric defect detection" ([doi.org](https://doi.org/10.1177/0040517520928604)). Paper credits: Jing, Junfeng; Wang, Zhen; Ratsch, Matthias; and Zhang, Huanhuan.

### Versions:

### v0.0.11
* Intermediate features, besides model output, are made avaliable at UNets.

### v0.0.8
* ESPNet temporalily removed, until development is completed.

### v0.0.7
* UNet5, UNet4, UNet2 are mature models.
* MobileUNet works well. Needs mode experiments.
* ESPNet on probation, performance issues need investigation.
